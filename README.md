Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is systematic development of high quality software using engineering methods tools and principles. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- Development of Programming languages like C and Fortran
- Establishment of Software engineering as a discipline
- Rise of Agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Requirements gathering which involves gathering and docmenting user requirement
- Design which involves creating detailed high level designs of the system
- Implementation involves writing code to create the desired application
- Testing involves detecting and fixing of bugs
- Deployment involves delivering the application to the intendeded user
- Maintanance involves providing ongoing software updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

- Waterfall is a sequential aproach to software engineering while Agile method is a iterative process focused on flexibility
- Wterfall is suitable when the requirements are know upfront while Agile is suitable when requirements change frequently

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- A Software Developer writes code and implements software solutions
- A Quality Assurace Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
- Project Manager oversees planning execution and delivery of software products

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- IDEs enables a developer to write and debug code. An example is VS Code Editor
- VCS enables collaboration by tracking changes made to code. An example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Challenges include changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt
- Solutions include effective communication, agile methodologies and prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- unit testing involves testing individual components of a system
- integration testing involves testing the interaction between different components
- system testing involves testing the entire system as a whole
- acceptance testing involves testing a system against user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions to get the best possible response from AI models. It helps to avoid confusing answers

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- vague prompt: Explain the term redundancy.
- clear prompt: Explain the term redundancy in the context of database management systems
- The improved prompt is more effective because it has a context which ensures accurate answers
